Project Overview
In this project, you'll build a basic machine learning model for flower species prediction, leveraging the renowned Iris dataset. This dataset encompasses measurements of four key features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) for three distinct iris flower species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Dataset
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples, with each sample having four features and a corresponding label indicating the species of the iris flower.

Features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Labels:

Setosa
